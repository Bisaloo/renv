\usage{
lockfile_create(
  type = settings$snapshot.type(project = project),
  libpaths = .libPaths(),
  packages = NULL,
  exclude = NULL,
  ...,
  project = NULL
)

lockfile_read(file = NULL, ..., project = NULL)

lockfile_write(lockfile, file = NULL, ..., project = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{type}{The type of package to install ("source" or "binary"). Defaults
to the value of \code{getOption("pkgType")}.}

\item{libpaths}{The library paths to be used when generating the lockfile.}

\item{packages}{A vector of packages to be included in the lockfile. When
\code{NULL} (the default), all packages relevant for the type of snapshot being
performed will be included. When set, the \code{type} argument is ignored.
Recursive dependencies of the specified packages will be added to the
lockfile as well.}

\item{exclude}{A vector of packages to be explicitly excluded from the lockfile.
Note that transitive package dependencies will always be included, to avoid
potentially creating an incomplete / non-functional lockfile.}

\item{...}{Unused arguments, reserved for future expansion. If any arguments
are matched to \code{...}, renv will signal an error.}

\item{project}{The project directory. If \code{NULL}, then the active project will
be used. If no project is currently active, then the current working
directory is used instead.}

\item{lockfile}{An \code{renv} lockfile, typically created either by
\code{\link[=lockfile_read]{lockfile_read()}} or \link{snapshot(file = NULL)}.}
}
\description{
A \strong{lockfile} records the state of a project at some point in time.
}
\details{
A lockfile captures the state of a project's library at some point in time.
In particular, the package names, their versions, and their sources (when
known) are recorded in the lockfile.

Projects can be restored from a lockfile using the \code{\link[=restore]{restore()}} function. This
implies reinstalling packages into the project's private library, as encoded
within the lockfile.

While lockfiles are normally generated and used with \code{\link[=snapshot]{snapshot()}} /
\code{\link[=restore]{restore()}}, they can also be edited by hand if so desired. Lockfiles are
written as \code{.json}, to allow for easy consumption by other tools.

An example lockfile follows:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode">}}\preformatted{\{
  "R": \{
    "Version": "3.6.1",
    "Repositories": [
      \{
        "Name": "CRAN",
        "URL": "https://cloud.r-project.org"
      \}
    ]
  \},
  "Packages": \{
    "markdown": \{
      "Package": "markdown",
      "Version": "1.0",
      "Source": "Repository",
      "Repository": "CRAN",
      "Hash": "4584a57f565dd7987d59dda3a02cfb41"
    \},
    "mime": \{
      "Package": "mime",
      "Version": "0.7",
      "Source": "Repository",
      "Repository": "CRAN",
      "Hash": "908d95ccbfd1dd274073ef07a7c93934"
    \}
  \}
\}
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}

The sections used within a lockfile are described next.
\subsection{renv}{

Information about the version of renv used to manage this project.

\tabular{ll}{
\strong{Version}     \tab The version of the renv package used with this project. \cr
}
}

\subsection{R}{

Properties related to the version of \R associated with this project.

\tabular{ll}{
\strong{Version}      \tab The version of \R used. \cr
\strong{Repositories} \tab The \R repositories used in this project. \cr
}
}

\subsection{Packages}{

\R package records, capturing the packages used or required by a project
at the time when the lockfile was generated.

\tabular{ll}{
\strong{Package}      \tab The package name. \cr
\strong{Version}      \tab The package version. \cr
\strong{Source}       \tab The location from which this package was retrieved. \cr
\strong{Repository}   \tab The name of the repository (if any) from which this package was retrieved. \cr
\strong{Hash}         \tab (Optional) A unique hash for this package, used for package caching. \cr
}

Additional remote fields, further describing how the package can be
retrieved from its corresponding source, will also be included as
appropriate (e.g. for packages installed from GitHub).
}

\subsection{Python}{

Metadata related to the version of Python used with this project (if any).

\tabular{ll}{
\strong{Version} \tab The version of Python being used. \cr
\strong{Type}    \tab The type of Python environment being used ("virtualenv", "conda", "system") \cr
\strong{Name}    \tab The (optional) name of the environment being used.
}

Note that the \code{Name} field may be empty. In that case, a project-local Python
environment will be used instead (when not directly using a system copy of Python).
